# Flashcard App Mobile

### Flashcard App made in Xamarin and C# designed for remembering words when learning a new language.

I've made two of these before, one for windows with windows forms and C# and the other for linux with Qt and C++. This one is better than the previous 2, as it supports multiple test settings as well as the ability to add multiple possible translations. Its lack of good looks, polish and smooth animation makes it unfit for publishing on the store.

Had database connection with CosmosDB, however it is no longer active.
